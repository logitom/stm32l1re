/**
 * @mainpage
 * @section Introduction
 *	Contiki6LP is a middleware for STM32Cube and specifically the X-CUBE-SUBG1 expansion software.
 *	The key features of Contiki6LP are:
 *		- Middleware library with Contiki OS and Contiki 6LoWPAN protocol stack 3.x
 *		- Support for mesh networking technology by the means of the standard RPL protocol
 *		- Built-in support for STM32 L1 and F4 platforms.
 *		- Easy portability across different STM32 MCU families thanks to STM32Cube.
 *		- Sample applications enabling communication via UDP over 6LoWPAN.
 *		- Free user-friendly license terms.
 *		- Examples available for NUCLEO-F401RE and NUCLEO-L152RE boards.
 *
 *	This software provides a porting of the Contiki OS for the STM32 platform, in the STM32Cube software environment, enabling the support for the SPIRIT1 sub-1GHz radio transceiver.
 *	The package also includes three sample applications that the developer can use to start experimenting with the code. Two of these applications are supposed to be used together since they implement the communication between two nodes. A sender node (@ref Udp_sender) is going to periodically send UDP packets to a receiver node (@ref Udp_receiver) looking up for a specific service number in the same 6LoWPAN network. A third application implements a 6LoWPAN border router (@ref Border_router) functionality.
